<h3>GofTfromCofW</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A program that generates Line Broadening functions, g(t), for use in simulations (via the MBO model) of both time-resolved and frequency resolved non-linear signals from a spectral density, c(W). Requires a C++ compiler.</p>

<h3>SimulateABS</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Code for generating absorption spectra (via the MBO model) using either FFT or direct integration algorithms. <em>Requires a C++ compiler.</em></p>

<h3>VEResponse</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">MATLAB code that calculates the solvation dynamics of a solute emmersed in a bath which is described as a viscoelastic medium as per Mark Berg's model. See Appendix B of DSL's thesis for pertinent details of the VE model. Includes both isotropic and anisotropic responses.</p>

<h3>Matlab</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Misc. MATLAB scripts. Useful for those that know of the various matlab scripts (e.g. photon echoes, pump-probe, pump-dump-probe, wavelets, 2-D Raman, manipulating molecular dynamics simulations) I've written over the years.</p>
