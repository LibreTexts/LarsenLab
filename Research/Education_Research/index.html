<p style="text-align: justify;">To increase my quality of teaching and understand the&nbsp;mechanisms of online student learning, Prof. Larsen&nbsp;founded the LibreText&nbsp;project, of which the chemistry library&nbsp;(<a href="http://chem.LibreTexts.org" rel="freeklink" title="http://chem.LibreTexts.org">http://chem.LibreTexts.org</a>) is the most developed constituent library. This project is a&nbsp;collaborative approach toward chemistry education where an Open Access textbook environment is&nbsp;constantly being written and re-written partly by students, partly by faculty and partly by industry experts to&nbsp;result in a free and eventual high-quality chemistry textbook. The LibreTexts&nbsp;approach facilitates learning&nbsp;by engaging students in the content development. The LibreTexts&nbsp;is the most utilized chemistry education&nbsp;resources in the world, with ~4.3 million visitors/ month from across the US and around the world. Last</p>
