<p style="text-align: justify;">The Larsen Lab's&nbsp;research effort focuses on three efforts and spans both advancing
    fundamental&nbsp;research and technological applications of light initiated dynamics of condensed phase systems
    and&nbsp;understanding how students effectively use online classroom resources to improve education&nbsp;in
    post-secondary courses. The Larsen Labs's&nbsp;effort includes the application of advanced transient studies&nbsp;on
    novel systems with the goal of characterizing and directing the fundamental mechanisms involved&nbsp;in effective
    photochemical transformation in biological and manmade materials applications.&nbsp;Complementing these two
    experimental research lines is an open access resource (OER) research effort of&nbsp;building the LibreTexts
    (formerly ChemWiki)&nbsp;as an Open online resource and learning how students can use it effectively.</p>
